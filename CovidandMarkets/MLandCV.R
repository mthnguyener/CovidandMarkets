# 1 Select various models and specifications to evaluate

# 2 Split the data into train and test subsets 

# 3 Fit (train) the models with the train subset

# 4 Make predictions with the test subset using the fitted (trained) models

# 5 Compute the MSE or deviance statistics of the test predictions

# 6 Re-sample, retrain and re-test the models several times

# 7 Select the model with the smallest test MSE or deviance

# 8 Once you select a model, re-fit that model using ALL the data (for statistical power) for actual predictions
